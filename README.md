GatorGotchi is a free Chrome Extension designed to help students learn topics of their choice by simulating a virtual pet gator!

Our GatorGotchi prompts users to learn about specific topics within their chosen field, and encourages students to actively engage with their topic by testing their knowledge. 

GatorGotchi also motivates users to regularly interact with the GatorGotchi, as students are driven to maintain its "health" by using it daily, and improve its "happiness" by answering question correctly. The GatorGotchi is reactive to student involvement, expressing its health and happiness levels through a variety of chibi-inspired facial animations.

Our Project includes a Flask-based Backend and incorporates FireBase for data storage.
