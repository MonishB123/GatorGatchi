GatorGotchi is a free Chrome Extension designed to help students learn topics of their choice by simulating a virtual pet gator!

Our bot prompts users to learn about specific topics within their chosen field, and encourages students to actively engage with their topic by testing their knowledge. 

GatorGotchi also motivates users to regularly interact with the bot, as students are driven to maintain the bots "health" by using the bot daily, and improve its "happiness" by answering question correctly.

Our Project includes a Flask-based Backend and incorporates FireBase for data storage
