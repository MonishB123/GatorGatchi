GatorGotchi is a free Chrome Extension designed to help students learn topics of their choice by simulating a virtual pet gator!

Our GatorGotchi prompts users to learn about specific topics within their chosen field, and encourages students to actively engage with their topic by testing their knowledge. Short form multiple-choice questions are generated based on the student's selection of topics in order to create a fun yet extensive manner of learning.

GatorGotchi also motivates users to regularly interact with the GatorGotchi, as students are driven to maintain its "health" by using it daily, and improve its "happiness" by answering question correctly. The GatorGotchi is reactive to student involvement, expressing its health and happiness levels through a variety of chibi-inspired facial animations.

Our Project includes a Flask-based Backend, a JavaScript front-end for the design of the extension, and Google Gen-AI API to generate both questions and answers to test the user. Figma was utilized for frontend UI design, applying the developer mode code for HTML/CSS conversion.

Installation Instructions:
- Open chrome://extensions
- Turn on developer mode
- Select load unpack and extensions folder
- To run Flask, run "python server/app.py" in the local cmd
